DOH tests for Dojo Mobile.

All tests are dispatched into sub module. each module has the name of the dojox.mobile class it tests, except for:
* transition, that globally test the transitions;
* templating, that test the templates support for widgets and views.

To run all tests, launch dojox/mobile/tests/doh/runTests.html in the target browser.
To launch the tests for one module, launch dojox/mobile/tests/doh/module_name/runTests.html 
in the target browser.

Notes: 
1. Before running the tests, you need to ensure the browser zoom is at 1:1. This 
   impacts some of the tests which perform dimensional checks.
2. When running in IE, the following tests: ButtonsTests.html, ExpandingTextAreaTests.html, and 
   TextAreaTests.html, the dimensional checks are calibrated for execution in IE9, 
   and the checks are skipped in older IE versions.
